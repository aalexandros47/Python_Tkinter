# Tkinter Calculator Project

Welcome to the Tkinter Calculator project! This Python application demonstrates how to create a basic yet fully functional calculator using Tkinter, Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: A clear, straightforward layout makes calculations simple.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message for invalid inputs or operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project was built using Python 3.x.
